# Agent Instructions

This project uses **br** (beads_rust) for issue tracking. Run `br onboard` to get started.

**Note:** `br` is non-invasive and never executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

## Quick Reference

```bash
br ready              # Find available work
br show <id>          # View issue details
br update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
br close <id>         # Complete work
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL
git add .beads/
git commit -m "sync beads"
```

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - **CRITICAL for Rust: MUST run `cargo build` and `cargo test` before closing tasks**
   ```bash
   cargo build          # Full build (REQUIRED before closing tasks)
   cargo test           # Run all unit tests (REQUIRED)
   cargo check          # Quick typecheck (faster alternative)
   cargo clippy         # Linter (optional but recommended)
   ```
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/
   git commit -m "sync beads"
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use [MCP Agent Mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail).

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

#### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns everything you need in one call:
- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command

#### Other Commands

**Planning:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS (hubs/authorities), eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level` (healthy\|warning\|critical), `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels by: (pagerank × staleness × block_impact) / velocity |

**History & Change Tracking:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations: `stats`, `histories` (per-bead events/commits/milestones), `commit_index` |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles introduced/resolved |

**Other Commands:**
| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions, cycle breaks |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Self-contained interactive HTML visualization |

#### Scoping & Filtering

bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work (no blockers)
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank scores
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain

#### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**
- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl (verify consistency across calls)
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`; contains ref and resolved SHA

**Two-phase analysis:**
- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density — always available immediately
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles — check `status` flags

**For large graphs (>500 nodes):** Some metrics may be approximated or skipped. Always check `status`.

#### jq Quick Reference

bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
bv --robot-label-health | jq '.results.labels[] | select(.health_level == "critical")'

**Performance:** Phase 1 instant, Phase 2 async (500ms timeout). Prefer `--robot-plan` over `--robot-insights` when speed matters. Results cached by data hash.

Use bv instead of parsing beads.jsonl—it computes PageRank, critical paths, cycles, and parallel tracks deterministically.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

**Note:** `br` is non-invasive and never executes git commands. After `br sync --flush-only`, you must manually run `git add .beads/ && git commit`.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync --flush-only  # Export to JSONL (then git add/commit)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always sync and commit at session end:
   ```bash
   br sync --flush-only
   git add .beads/
   git commit -m "sync beads"
   ```

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
# CRITICAL for Rust: Run these before committing
cargo build            # Full build (REQUIRED)
cargo test             # Run all unit tests (REQUIRED)
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads to JSONL
git add .beads/
git commit -m "..."     # Commit code and beads
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always sync and commit before ending session:
  ```bash
  br sync --flush-only
  git add .beads/
  git commit -m "sync beads"
  ```

## UBS Quick Reference for AI Agents

UBS stands for "Ultimate Bug Scanner": **The AI Coding Agent's Secret Weapon: Flagging Likely Bugs for Fixing Early On**

**Install:** `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/ultimate_bug_scanner/master/install.sh | bash`

**Golden Rule:** `ubs <changed-files>` before every commit. Exit 0 = safe. Exit >0 = fix & re-run.

**Commands:**
```bash
ubs file.ts file2.py                    # Specific files (< 1s) — USE THIS
ubs $(git diff --name-only --cached)    # Staged files — before commit
ubs --only=js,python src/               # Language filter (3-5x faster)
ubs --ci --fail-on-warning .            # CI mode — before PR
ubs --help                              # Full command reference
ubs sessions --entries 1                # Tail the latest install session log
ubs .                                   # Whole project (ignores things like .venv and node_modules automatically)
```

**Output Format:**
```
⚠️  Category (N errors)
    file.ts:42:5 – Issue description
    💡 Suggested fix
Exit code: 1
```
Parse: `file:line:col` → location | 💡 → how to fix | Exit 0/1 → pass/fail

**Fix Workflow:**
1. Read finding → category + fix suggestion
2. Navigate `file:line:col` → view context
3. Verify real issue (not false positive)
4. Fix root cause (not symptom)
5. Re-run `ubs <file>` → exit 0
6. Commit

**Speed Critical:** Scope to changed files. `ubs src/file.ts` (< 1s) vs `ubs .` (30s). Never full scan for small edits.

**Bug Severity:**
- **Critical** (always fix): Null safety, XSS/injection, async/await, memory leaks
- **Important** (production): Type narrowing, division-by-zero, resource leaks
- **Contextual** (judgment): TODO/FIXME, console logs

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Ignore findings → ✅ Investigate each
- ❌ Full scan per edit → ✅ Scope to file
- ❌ Fix symptom (`if (x) { x.y }`) → ✅ Root cause (`x?.y`)

## Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for web automation. Run `agent-browser --help` for all commands.

Core workflow:
1. `agent-browser open <url>` - Navigate to page
2. `agent-browser snapshot -i` - Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2)
3. `agent-browser click @e1` / `fill @e2 "text"` - Interact using refs
4. Re-snapshot after page changes

## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Same repository
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.

2) Across different repos in one project (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.

## Integrating with Beads (dependency-aware task planning)

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and a CLI (`bd`) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging, audit trail, and file-reservation signals. Project: [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Recommended conventions
- **Single source of truth**: Use **Beads** for task status/priority/dependencies; use **Agent Mail** for conversation, decisions, and attachments (audit).
- **Shared identifiers**: Use the Beads issue id (e.g., `bd-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[bd-123]`.
- **Reservations**: When starting a `bd-###` task, call `file_reservation_paths(...)` for the affected paths; include the issue id in the `reason` and release on completion.

Typical flow (agents)
1) **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `bd ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2) **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="bd-123")`
3) **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="bd-123", subject="[bd-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4) **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5) **Complete and release**
   - `bd close bd-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[bd-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `bd-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[bd-###] …`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `bd-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `bd-###` for traceability

Event mirroring (optional automation)
- On `bd update --status blocked`, send a high-importance Mail message in thread `bd-###` describing the blocker.
- On Mail "ACK overdue" for a critical decision, add a Beads label (e.g., `needs-ack`) or bump priority to surface it in `bd ready`.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Don't create or manage tasks in Mail; treat Beads as the single task queue.
- Always include `bd-###` in message `thread_id` to avoid ID drift across tools.

### Using bv as an AI sidecar

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (.beads/beads.jsonl). Instead of parsing JSONL or hallucinating graph traversal, use robot flags for deterministic, dependency-aware outputs with precomputed metrics (PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, k-core).
